<br/>Hello there, <br/><br/>

My name is Jamie Lee. I graduated from the Georgia Institute of Technology with a degree in Business Administration. I am highly interested in your QA Automation Engineer job opportunity and I think that I would be a fitting candidate. I worked at Aon Hewitt for three years where I was a software tester. Aon Hewitt is a benefits outsourcing company, which means that the company handles the health insurance, investments and pension plan choices of employees who belong to other companies. I learned very quickly about the company's testing procedures and how to use the proprietary software. I acquired exposure to large amounts of data, learning how to navigate databases and how to code with SQL. In my free time, I learned Python and Ruby so that I could create web scripts and Windows GUI application scripts in order to automate parts of my job. I gained extensive experience using the Selenium web driver module while programming my Python web automation scripts. I love creating automation scripts and programming in general. I also code with HTML, CSS3 and JavaScript in my free time, sometimes with my friends. I am mostly self-taught/self-directed.
<br/><br/>
My other core job responsibilities included implementing system-wide changes requested by our clients, finding any bugs and fixing them. I analyzed problems and proposed solutions for both the web interface and the GUI application. Whenever I made any changes to the system, I provided highly detailed documentation of the analysis and the steps involved in implementing the solution. I designed test plans in accordance with the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) model.
<br/><br/>
I am passionate about automation and scripting, so I would be absolutely delighted to hear from you!
<br/><br/>
Thank you,<br/>
Jamie
