  div(class="content-area") Hello! </br></br> My name is Jamie Lee. Welcome to my website. I wish to become more skilled at art, design and programming, so I made this website where I will post my projects. I wanted to have my own virtual space where I can be creative. I made this website from scratch. I am not a coder, but it was really fun to set up a personal website. </br></br>
