<h1>Thoughts on Confidence and Arrogance</h1>

Confidence has always been an elusive trait for me. I struggled with it my entire life. The fear of interacting with people was not a big deal when I was a kid. But now that I had entered adulthood, it started to concern me since I would have to be interviewing with companies for jobs. Obviously the #1 thing that companies look for is confidence. I decided it was in my best interest to do all that I could to obtain the skill of being confident. I attended a college seminar regarding career advice. The speaker told us that if we wanted our dream career, one should "Fake it 'til you make it". The phrase resonated with me back then, because I was young and highly impressionable. I tried my hardest to create a fake persona that would inspire others, namely recruiters and hiring managers, to believe in me.

However, in the long term, I slowly realized that by faking confidence, I was beginning to fake my personality. It made me fragile. I would constantly worry about being "found out". It would not be surprising if this culture of faking is the cause of imposter syndrome. We all want to put our best foot forward, but spending time refining our outer images saps time away from building upon actual skills. And it is the strengthening of actual skills that leads to true and unshakeable confidence. </br></br>

Confidence turns into arrogance when someone believes that he is better than the people around him in some way. And sometimes this attitude seems rationally justifiable. But even so, a demeanor of superiority can create negativity in relationships of any kind. An effective way to stay humble is to surround yourself with people whom you respect and admire. If that is not possible, then an alternative would be to read about amazing people. It also helps to remind yourself to treat everyone with respect. It is a good guideline to have if you wish to be a decent human being.</br></br>
